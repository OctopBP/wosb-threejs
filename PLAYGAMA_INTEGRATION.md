# Playgama SDK Integration

## Overview

The basic Playgama SDK has been successfully integrated into the World of Sea Battle Three.js game. This integration provides the essential platform communication needed for game distribution on the Playgama network without any ads, in-app purchases, or advanced features.

## What Was Integrated

### 1. SDK Script Loading
- Added the Playgama Bridge SDK script to `index.html`
- The SDK loads from CDN: `https://cdn.playgama.com/sdk/playgama-bridge.js`

### 2. TypeScript SDK Wrapper
- Created `src/PlaygamaSDK.ts` with a TypeScript wrapper class
- Provides type-safe methods for SDK interaction
- Implements singleton pattern for global access
- Includes error handling and fallback for missing SDK

### 3. Game Lifecycle Integration
- **Loading Events**: Notifies the platform when game loading starts and finishes
- **Gameplay Events**: Signals when gameplay begins and ends
- **Pause/Resume**: Handles platform-initiated game pausing and resuming
- **Player Data**: Basic save/load functionality (ready for future use)

### 4. Game Engine Integration
- Modified `src/AppOne.ts` to support pause/resume functionality
- Integrated with the main game loop to stop updates when paused
- Added proper cleanup when the game ends

## SDK Features Used

### Core Features
- `gameLoadingStart()` - Called when assets start loading
- `gameLoadingFinished()` - Called when assets finish loading
- `gameplayStart()` - Called when gameplay begins
- `gameplayStop()` - Called when gameplay ends or game closes

### Player Data (Basic)
- `savePlayerData()` - Save player progress
- `loadPlayerData()` - Load player progress

### Platform Events
- `pause` event - Game paused by platform
- `resume` event - Game resumed by platform

## Game Flow

1. **Initialization**: SDK initializes before game assets load
2. **Loading**: Game notifies SDK when loading starts/finishes
3. **Gameplay**: Game signals when gameplay begins
4. **Platform Integration**: Handles pause/resume from platform
5. **Cleanup**: Properly notifies SDK when game ends

## Requirements Met

✅ Basic SDK integration without ads  
✅ No in-app purchases (IAP) integration  
✅ Platform communication for game distribution  
✅ Game lifecycle event tracking  
✅ Pause/resume functionality  
✅ TypeScript type safety  
✅ Error handling and fallbacks  

## Future Enhancements

The integration is designed to be extensible. Future additions could include:
- Leaderboards
- Social features  
- Remote configuration
- Advanced analytics
- Ad integration (if needed later)

## Testing

The game builds successfully and maintains all existing functionality while adding Playgama platform support. The SDK gracefully handles cases where the platform is not available (local development).

## Files Modified

- `index.html` - Added SDK script tag
- `src/main.ts` - SDK initialization and lifecycle integration
- `src/AppOne.ts` - Pause/resume functionality
- `src/PlaygamaSDK.ts` - New SDK wrapper class (created)
- `PLAYGAMA_INTEGRATION.md` - This documentation (created)
