# Task 3: Combat System Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented the combat system with health, weapons, projectiles, and damage mechanics as requested in Task 3.

## âœ… Issues Fixed
- **Proper Mesh Types**: Removed ship mesh reuse for projectiles and obstacles
- **Self-Damage Prevention**: Collision system properly prevents ships from damaging themselves
- **Primitive Mesh Support**: Added support for sphere and box primitives in the rendering system

## Features Implemented

### 1. Health System
- **HealthComponent**: Tracks current health, max health, and death state
- Added to player entity with 100 HP
- Test obstacle created with 50 HP

### 2. Weapon System
- **WeaponComponent**: Configurable weapon stats (damage, fire rate, range, projectile speed)
- **WeaponSystem**: Handles automatic shooting every 3 seconds (configurable)
- Player shoots forward in their facing direction
- Projectiles are created as **proper sphere primitives** (not ship meshes)

### 3. Projectile System
- **ProjectileComponent**: Tracks damage, speed, owner, and lifetime
- **ProjectileSystem**: Manages projectile movement and automatic cleanup
- Projectiles despawn after traveling maximum range
- Visual representation using **proper Babylon.js sphere meshes**

### 4. Damage & Collision System
- **DamageableComponent**: Marker component for entities that can take damage
- **CollisionSystem**: Handles collision detection between projectiles and damageable entities
- Applies damage on hit and destroys projectiles
- **PREVENTS SELF-DAMAGE**: Ships cannot damage themselves with their own projectiles

## Configuration Files

### ModelConfig.ts (Updated)
Added support for primitive mesh types:
- **Sphere**: For projectiles (0.2 diameter, 8 segments for performance)
- **Box**: For obstacles (1x1x1 dimensions)
- **Ship**: For ship entities (GLTF model)

### WeaponConfig.ts
Provides configurable weapon presets:
- **Basic Cannon**: 25 damage, fires every 3 seconds, 15 range
- **Fast Cannon**: 15 damage, fires every 1 second, 12 range (future use)
- **Heavy Cannon**: 50 damage, fires every 5 seconds, 20 range (future use)

## Architecture

### ECS Integration
All combat features follow the existing ECS architecture:
- **Components**: Data-only structures (Health, Weapon, Projectile, Damageable)
- **Systems**: Logic processors that operate on component combinations
- **Entities**: Containers that hold components

### Enhanced Rendering System
- **RenderSystem** now supports both GLTF models and primitive meshes
- Automatically detects mesh type and creates appropriate Babylon.js meshes
- Primitives (spheres, boxes) for performance, models for detailed entities

### System Execution Order
1. InputSystem
2. RotationSystem
3. AccelerationSystem
4. MovementSystem
5. **WeaponSystem** (NEW) - Handles weapon firing
6. **ProjectileSystem** (NEW) - Updates projectile lifetimes
7. **CollisionSystem** (NEW) - Processes collisions and damage with self-damage prevention
8. RenderSystem

## Testing Setup

### Test Obstacle
- Created a test obstacle entity 5 units in front of the player
- Has 50 HP and can take damage
- Uses **box primitive mesh** instead of ship model
- Clearly distinguishable from player ship

### Self-Damage Prevention
- Collision system checks `projectile.ownerId` against `target.id`
- Ships cannot hit themselves with their own projectiles
- Verified through entity ID comparison in collision detection

### Debug Methods
Added methods to GameWorld for monitoring:
- `getPlayerHealth()`: Returns player health status
- `getObstacleHealth()`: Returns test obstacle health status
- `updatePlayerWeaponConfig()`: Allows runtime weapon tuning

## How to Test

1. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
2. Player will automatically shoot **sphere projectiles** forward every 3 seconds
3. Test obstacle appears as a **box shape** 5 units in front of player
4. Player can move around without taking damage from own projectiles
5. When projectiles hit the obstacle, it takes damage and eventually is destroyed
6. Monitor health values in browser console or through debug methods

## Key Design Decisions

### Proper Mesh Types
- **Projectiles**: Use sphere primitives (lightweight, appropriate shape)
- **Obstacles**: Use box primitives (clear visual distinction)
- **Ships**: Use detailed GLTF models (high visual quality)

### Self-Damage Prevention
- Implemented at collision detection level for efficiency
- Uses entity ownership tracking via `ownerId` field
- Prevents friendly fire scenarios automatically

### Performance Considerations
- Projectiles use low-poly sphere meshes (8 segments)
- Automatic cleanup after range limit to prevent memory leaks
- Collision system only checks active projectiles against damageable entities
- Primitive mesh rendering for better performance than complex models

### Scalability
- Component-based design allows easy addition of new weapon types
- System architecture supports multiple shooters and targets
- Primitive mesh system extensible to other shapes (cylinders, etc.)

## Future Enhancements Ready
The system is designed to easily support:
- Multiple weapon types per entity
- Different projectile shapes and behaviors
- Area-of-effect damage
- Weapon upgrades and modifications
- Visual effects and particle systems
- Sound effects for shooting and impacts
- Team-based combat with faction systems
