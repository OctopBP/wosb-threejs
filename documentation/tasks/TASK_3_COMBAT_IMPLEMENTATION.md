# Task 3: Combat System Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented the combat system with health, weapons, projectiles, and damage mechanics as requested in Task 3.

## ✅ Issues Fixed
- **Proper Mesh Types**: Removed ship mesh reuse for projectiles and obstacles
- **Self-Damage Prevention**: Collision system properly prevents ships from damaging themselves
- **Primitive Mesh Support**: Added support for sphere and box primitives in the rendering system
- **Arc Trajectory**: Projectiles now follow realistic arc trajectories with gravity physics

## Features Implemented

### 1. Health System
- **HealthComponent**: Tracks current health, max health, and death state
- Added to player entity with 100 HP
- Test obstacle created with 50 HP

### 2. Weapon System
- **WeaponComponent**: Configurable weapon stats (damage, fire rate, range, projectile speed)
- **WeaponSystem**: Handles automatic shooting every 3 seconds (configurable)
- Player shoots forward in their facing direction
- Projectiles are created as **proper sphere primitives** with **arc trajectories**

### 3. Projectile System
- **ProjectileComponent**: Tracks damage, speed, owner, and lifetime
- **ProjectileSystem**: Manages projectile lifetimes and cleanup
- **ProjectileMovementSystem**: Handles realistic physics with gravity
- **Arc Trajectory**: Projectiles follow parabolic paths due to gravity
- Visual representation using **proper Babylon.js sphere meshes**

### 4. Damage & Collision System
- **DamageableComponent**: Marker component for entities that can take damage
- **CollisionSystem**: Handles collision detection between projectiles and damageable entities
- Applies damage on hit and destroys projectiles
- **PREVENTS SELF-DAMAGE**: Ships cannot damage themselves with their own projectiles
- Adjusted collision radius for proper sphere-to-box collision detection

## Configuration Files

### ModelConfig.ts (Updated)
Added support for primitive mesh types:
- **Sphere**: For projectiles (0.2 diameter, 8 segments for performance)
- **Box**: For obstacles (1x1x1 dimensions)
- **Ship**: For ship entities (GLTF model)

### WeaponConfig.ts (Enhanced)
Provides configurable weapon presets:
- **Basic Cannon**: 25 damage, fires every 3 seconds, 15 range
- **Fast Cannon**: 15 damage, fires every 1 second, 12 range (future use)
- **Heavy Cannon**: 50 damage, fires every 5 seconds, 20 range (future use)

**NEW: Projectile Physics Configuration**:
```typescript
export const projectilePhysicsConfig = {
    gravity: -9.8,          // Gravity acceleration (m/s²)
    upwardVelocity: 2.0,    // Initial upward velocity for arc
    heightOffset: 0.2,      // Spawn height above shooter
    forwardOffset: 0.5,     // Spawn distance in front of shooter
}
```

## Architecture

### ECS Integration
All combat features follow the existing ECS architecture:
- **Components**: Data-only structures (Health, Weapon, Projectile, Damageable)
- **Systems**: Logic processors that operate on component combinations
- **Entities**: Containers that hold components

### Enhanced Rendering System
- **RenderSystem** now supports both GLTF models and primitive meshes
- Automatically detects mesh type and creates appropriate Babylon.js meshes
- Primitives (spheres, boxes) for performance, models for detailed entities

### Projectile Physics
- **ProjectileMovementSystem**: Dedicated system for projectile physics
- Applies gravity for realistic arc trajectories
- Updates projectile rotation to face movement direction
- Separate from ship movement system for different physics rules

### System Execution Order
1. InputSystem
2. RotationSystem
3. AccelerationSystem
4. MovementSystem (ships with movementConfig)
5. **WeaponSystem** (NEW) - Handles weapon firing
6. **ProjectileMovementSystem** (NEW) - Moves projectiles with gravity physics
7. **ProjectileSystem** (NEW) - Updates projectile lifetimes
8. **CollisionSystem** (NEW) - Processes collisions and damage with self-damage prevention
9. RenderSystem

## Testing Setup

### Test Obstacle
- Created a test obstacle entity 5 units in front of the player
- Has 50 HP and can take damage
- Uses **box primitive mesh** instead of ship model
- Clearly distinguishable from player ship

### Projectile Arc Physics
- Projectiles spawn slightly above and in front of shooter
- Initial upward velocity creates arc trajectory
- Gravity pulls projectiles down over time
- Extended lifetime to account for arc travel time

### Self-Damage Prevention
- Collision system checks `projectile.ownerId` against `target.id`
- Ships cannot hit themselves with their own projectiles
- Verified through entity ID comparison in collision detection

### Debug Methods
Added methods to GameWorld for monitoring:
- `getPlayerHealth()`: Returns player health status
- `getObstacleHealth()`: Returns test obstacle health status
- `updatePlayerWeaponConfig()`: Allows runtime weapon tuning

## How to Test

1. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
2. Player will automatically shoot **sphere projectiles** in arc trajectories every 3 seconds
3. Test obstacle appears as a **box shape** 5 units in front of player
4. **Watch projectiles arc through the air** with realistic gravity physics
5. Player can move around without taking damage from own projectiles
6. When projectiles hit the obstacle, it takes damage and eventually is destroyed
7. Monitor health values in browser console or through debug methods

## Key Design Decisions

### Realistic Projectile Physics
- **Arc Trajectories**: Projectiles follow parabolic paths due to gravity
- **Initial Upward Velocity**: Gives projectiles proper launching angle
- **Configurable Physics**: Gravity, launch angle, and spawn position are all configurable
- **Separate Movement System**: Projectiles have different physics than ships

### Proper Mesh Types
- **Projectiles**: Use sphere primitives (lightweight, appropriate shape)
- **Obstacles**: Use box primitives (clear visual distinction)
- **Ships**: Use detailed GLTF models (high visual quality)

### Self-Damage Prevention
- Implemented at collision detection level for efficiency
- Uses entity ownership tracking via `ownerId` field
- Prevents friendly fire scenarios automatically

### Performance Considerations
- Projectiles use low-poly sphere meshes (8 segments)
- Automatic cleanup after range limit to prevent memory leaks
- Collision system only checks active projectiles against damageable entities
- Primitive mesh rendering for better performance than complex models
- Extended lifetime accounts for arc trajectory without being excessive

### Scalability
- Component-based design allows easy addition of new weapon types
- System architecture supports multiple shooters and targets
- Configurable physics system allows different projectile behaviors
- Primitive mesh system extensible to other shapes (cylinders, etc.)

## Future Enhancements Ready
The system is designed to easily support:
- Multiple weapon types with different arc characteristics
- Different projectile shapes and physics behaviors
- Explosive projectiles with area-of-effect damage
- Weapon upgrades that modify trajectory and physics
- Visual effects and particle trails for projectiles
- Sound effects for shooting, flying, and impacts
- Team-based combat with faction systems
- Wind effects that influence projectile trajectories
