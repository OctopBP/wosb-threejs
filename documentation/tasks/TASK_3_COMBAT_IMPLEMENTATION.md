# Task 3: Combat System Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented the combat system with health, weapons, projectiles, and damage mechanics as requested in Task 3.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Health System
- **HealthComponent**: Tracks current health, max health, and death state
- Added to player entity with 100 HP
- Test obstacle created with 50 HP

### 2. Weapon System
- **WeaponComponent**: Configurable weapon stats (damage, fire rate, range, projectile speed)
- **WeaponSystem**: Handles automatic shooting every 3 seconds (configurable)
- Player shoots forward in their facing direction
- Projectiles are created as sphere primitives

### 3. Projectile System
- **ProjectileComponent**: Tracks damage, speed, owner, and lifetime
- **ProjectileSystem**: Manages projectile movement and automatic cleanup
- Projectiles despawn after traveling maximum range
- Visual representation using Babylon.js sphere meshes

### 4. Damage & Collision System
- **DamageableComponent**: Marker component for entities that can take damage
- **CollisionSystem**: Handles collision detection between projectiles and damageable entities
- Applies damage on hit and destroys projectiles
- Prevents friendly fire (projectiles don't hit their owner)

## Configuration Files

### WeaponConfig.ts
Provides configurable weapon presets:
- **Basic Cannon**: 25 damage, fires every 3 seconds, 15 range
- **Fast Cannon**: 15 damage, fires every 1 second, 12 range (future use)
- **Heavy Cannon**: 50 damage, fires every 5 seconds, 20 range (future use)

## Architecture

### ECS Integration
All combat features follow the existing ECS architecture:
- **Components**: Data-only structures (Health, Weapon, Projectile, Damageable)
- **Systems**: Logic processors that operate on component combinations
- **Entities**: Containers that hold components

### System Execution Order
1. InputSystem
2. RotationSystem
3. AccelerationSystem
4. MovementSystem
5. **WeaponSystem** (NEW) - Handles weapon firing
6. **ProjectileSystem** (NEW) - Updates projectile lifetimes
7. **CollisionSystem** (NEW) - Processes collisions and damage
8. RenderSystem

## Testing Setup

### Test Obstacle
- Created a test obstacle entity 5 units in front of the player
- Has 50 HP and can take damage
- Uses ship model for visual representation (temporary)

### Debug Methods
Added methods to GameWorld for monitoring:
- `getPlayerHealth()`: Returns player health status
- `getObstacleHealth()`: Returns test obstacle health status
- `updatePlayerWeaponConfig()`: Allows runtime weapon tuning

## How to Test

1. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
2. Player will automatically shoot forward every 3 seconds
3. If aimed correctly, projectiles will hit the test obstacle
4. Monitor health values in browser console or through debug methods
5. Test obstacle should take damage and eventually be destroyed

## Key Design Decisions

### Flexibility & Configurability
- Weapon stats are externalized in configuration files
- Easy to create new weapon types by extending configurations
- Collision detection uses simple distance-based algorithm (scalable to more complex systems)

### Performance Considerations
- Projectiles automatically cleanup after range limit
- Collision system only checks active projectiles against damageable entities
- Low-poly sphere meshes for projectile rendering

### Scalability
- Component-based design allows easy addition of new weapon types
- System architecture supports multiple shooters and targets
- Damage system supports future modifiers and special effects

## Future Enhancements Ready
The system is designed to easily support:
- Multiple weapon types per entity
- Area-of-effect damage
- Weapon upgrades and modifications
- Visual effects and particle systems
- Sound effects for shooting and impacts
- Different projectile types and behaviors
