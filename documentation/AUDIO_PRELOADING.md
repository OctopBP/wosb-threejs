# Audio Preloading System

## Overview

The audio preloading system has been implemented to load and prepare all audio assets before the game starts, ensuring smooth audio playback without interruptions during gameplay.

## Architecture

### Components

1. **AudioPreloader** (`src/AudioPreloader.ts`)
   - Handles loading audio files as ArrayBuffers
   - Decodes them to AudioBuffers using a temporary AudioContext
   - Provides progress tracking during loading
   - Manages cleanup of temporary resources

2. **Enhanced AudioSystem** (`src/systems/AudioSystem.ts`)
   - Now accepts preloaded audio buffers
   - Falls back to original loading method if no preloaded buffers available
   - Maintains compatibility with existing audio functionality

3. **Updated Initialization Flow** (`src/main.ts`)
   - Models are loaded first
   - Audio assets are loaded second with progress indication
   - Game starts only after all assets are ready

## Implementation Details

### Loading Sequence

1. **Page Load**: DOM content loaded event triggers
2. **Model Preloading**: Existing model preloader runs first
3. **Audio Preloading**: New audio preloader loads all audio assets
4. **Game Initialization**: App is created with preloaded audio buffers
5. **Audio System Setup**: AudioSystem receives preloaded buffers
6. **User Interaction**: AudioContext initialization still requires user interaction due to browser policies

### Benefits

- **Faster Audio Response**: Audio assets are ready immediately when needed
- **Smooth Gameplay**: No loading interruptions during game sessions
- **Better User Experience**: Loading progress is visible to users
- **Graceful Fallbacks**: System falls back to original behavior if preloading fails

### Browser Compatibility

The system handles browser autoplay policies correctly:
- Audio files are preloaded as data (allowed without user interaction)
- AudioContext creation and playback still require user interaction
- Fallback mechanisms ensure compatibility across browsers

## Usage

The audio preloading is automatic and transparent to the rest of the codebase. Existing audio system usage remains unchanged:

```typescript
// Audio system usage remains the same
audioSystem.playMusic('background')
audioSystem.playSfx('shoot')
audioSystem.playUI('button_click')
```

## Configuration

Audio assets are configured in `src/config/AudioConfig.ts` as before. The preloader automatically detects and loads all configured assets.

## Error Handling

- Individual asset loading failures don't prevent game startup
- Progress tracking continues even if some assets fail
- Comprehensive error logging for debugging
- Graceful degradation to original loading method

## Performance Impact

- Slightly longer initial loading time (assets loaded upfront)
- Reduced runtime loading overhead
- Better memory management with proper cleanup
- Improved overall game performance once started
